/**
 * @class Alloy.widgets.bouncylogo
 *
 * The **BouncyLogo** widget provides a animated logo that is suitable for displaying when your application first starts.
 *
 * ## Manifest
 * * Version: 1.0 (stable)
 * * Github: https://www.github.com/appcelerator/alloy
 * * License: [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)
 * * Author: Carl Orthlieb
 * * Supported Platforms: iOS, Android, Mobile Web
 *
 * ## Adding the BouncyLogo Widget to Your Alloy Project
 *
 * In your application's config.json file you will want to include the following line in your dependencies:
 *
 *     "dependencies": {
 *         "com.appcelerator.bouncylogo":"1.0"
 *     }
 *
 * ### Creating a Local Copy
 * Normally, BouncyLogo can be accessed without copying because it is part of Alloy. Adding it
 * as a dependency to your project is enough. However, if you want to create a copy local to your
 * application so that you can further modify it, then you will need to:
 *
 * 1. Create a widgets directory in your app directory if it does not already exist.
 * 2. Copy the `com.appcelerator.bouncylogo` folder from the `Resources/alloy/widgets` directory into your `app/widgets` directory.
 *
 * ## Adding the BouncyLogo to the View
 *
 * You can add a bouncy logo to a view by using the *Widget* tag to bring in the BouncyLogo widget.
 *
 *     <Widget src="com.appcelerator.bouncylogo" id="logo"/>
 *
 * Assign it an ID that you can use in your controller, for example, `id="logo"`. You can now access the
 * BouncyLogo via `$.logo` in your controller. Note that the containing view needs to have a
 * layout of "absolute", which is the default, and not "horizontal" or "vertical", in order
 * to have BouncyLogo work properly.
 *
 * Note that the logo starts offscreen and hidden, you will need to initialize it after your window
 * is open. Change your window to register for the `open` event if it has not already done so:
 *
 *     <Window onOpen="IndexOpen">
 *
 * ## Initializing the BouncyLogo in the Controller
 *
 * Note that your logo starts offscreen and hidden, you will need to initialize it after your
 * window is open. During the open call you will want to call the BouncyLogo with the `init`
 * method. For example:
 *
 *     function IndexOpen(e) {
 *         $.logo.init({ image: '/images/alloy.png', width: 216, height: 200 });
 *     }

    opacity: 0.5,           // Fade into the background after it settles

    durationBounce: 500,    // Duration to bounce before settling
    durationFade: 2000,     // Duration to fade to specified opacity
    bounciness: 0.25        // 0 = no bounce, 1 = full height bounce

 * @method init
 * Initializes the bouncy logo, then bounces the logo into position.

 * @param {Number} width Width of the logo.
 * @param {Number} height Height of the logo.
 * @param {Number} [opacity=0.5] The final opacity of the logo once animation is complete.
 * @param {Number} [durationIn=1000] The duration, in milliseconds, for the logo to slide onto the screeen.
